# This network must be unused in your network infrastructure!

# internal network node size allocation (optional). This is the size allocated
# to each node for pod IP address allocation. Note that the number of pods per node is
# also limited by the kubelet_max_pods variable which defaults to 110.
#
# Example:
# Up to 64 nodes and up to 254 or kubelet_max_pods (the lowest of the two) pods per node:
#  - kube_pods_subnet: 10.233.64.0/18
#  - kube_network_node_prefix: 24
#  - kubelet_max_pods: 110
#
# Example:
# Up to 128 nodes and up to 126 or kubelet_max_pods (the lowest of the two) pods per node:
#  - kube_pods_subnet: 10.233.64.0/18
#  - kube_network_node_prefix: 25
#  - kubelet_max_pods: 110
